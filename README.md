## Task 1

### To create a clone of a Figma Design

## Approach 

As the problem was of designing, the first thing that came in my mind was to start making the skeleton of that structure using the Html.
Then I relied on a CSS framework 'Bootstrap' to tackle all the styling issues.
I used navigation classses of CSS to first design the navigation bar of the design.
Then I used the Grid system of Bootstrap to do the rest of the design.
